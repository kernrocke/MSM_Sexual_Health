                among gbMSM residing in a high income small island 
                developing states. (Tentative)

Objective:

Analysis Plan

PREAMBLE

Justification

To date there has been limited studies focusing on Pre-exposure prophylaxsis and post-exposure prophylaxsis
among gbMSM in small island developing states. There is an inherent neeed for population based research in 
resource stricken settings. Currently in the Caribbean there are only two nationwide programmes which allow
for the distribution of PrEP to help reduce the transmission of HIV. 

ANALYSIS NOTES 

Consideration for prevalence estimate use estimate and 95% Confidence Intervals
